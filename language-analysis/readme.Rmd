# about
This is a work in progress.

This is a project where natural language processing will predict how a sentence should end.

This project takes data on twitter, blogs, and news in english and creates a corpus. N-grams are
generated and predictive analysis done using a katz-backoff model with a Kneser-ney smoothing.

ex., "me and John went to the _ _ _ _"
