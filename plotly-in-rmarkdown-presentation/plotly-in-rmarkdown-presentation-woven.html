# Gapminder

Gapminder is an interesting organization. I fist was introduced to them through a [Ted

# Disclaimer

Isn't it great that as life expectancy increased inversely with a decrease in child mortality?

Obviously, this information does not mean life-expectancy is directly correlated to child
mortality. Most likely breakthroughs in medicine led to improvements in both
