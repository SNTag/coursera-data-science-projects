# Gapminder

Gapminder is an interesting organization. I fist was introduced to them through a [Ted
Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w).

Using their data, I will attempt to recreate their plotting style on Life Expectancy vs. Child Mortality.

```
## Error in file(con, "rb"): cannot open the connection
```

# Disclaimer

Isn't it great that as life expectancy increased inversely with a decrease in child mortality? Medical improvements appear to be doing as we hope.

Obviously, this information does not mean life-expectancy is directly correlated to child
mortality. Most likely breakthroughs in medicine led to improvements in both
