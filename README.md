# Coursera data science projects

These are projects related to coursera data-science courses.

## projects
- [practice site for leaflet+Rmd](https://sntag.github.io/coursera-data-science-projects/leaflet-in-rmarkdown/leaflet-in-rmarkdown-exported.html)
Trial work using leaflet.

- [plotly in rmarkdown presentation](https://sntag.github.io/coursera-data-science-projects/plotly-in-rmarkdown-presentation/plotly-in-rmarkdown-presentation.html#1)
A quick & short intro to the Gapminder data.

- [shiny application](https://sntag.shinyapps.io/simple-shiny-application/)
A shiny application exploring the Kepler dataset. Only meant as a quick interface for possibly habitable planets in given parameters.

- [Machine-learning: What exercises](https://sntag.github.io/coursera-data-science-projects/prediction-assignment-writeup/prediction-assignment-completecase.html)
This project will attempt to identify exercise regimes followed from several patients biological data.

- [statistical inference part 1](https://github.com/SNTag/coursera-data-science-projects/blob/gh-pages/statistical-inference-part1/part1.pdf)
This assignment will explore whether the Central Limit Theory
([CLT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem#Classical_CLT)) can be applied to
exponential distributions. The CLT states that the distribution of averages for Independent and
Identically Distributed (iid) variables will approximate a normal distribution as sample size
increases.

- [statistical inference part 2](https://github.com/SNTag/coursera-data-science-projects/blob/gh-pages/statistical-inference-part1/part2.pdf)
The Tooth Growth dataset records the effects of vitamin C on Guinea Pig tooth growth. The Vitamin C
is delivered through either Orange Juice (OJ) or Vitamin C (VC). Which delivery approach results in
greatest tooth growth?
