Caravaggio is an amazing artist. While his art alone speaks to his skill, it doesn't tell of the colorful life he lived.

He was different from the standard artist like Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli, or Michelangelo. He
liked to drink and fight, and was a infamous figure. He refused to not cooperate with anyone, but
people kept buying his art for it's sheer skill. Eventually his home city of Florence grew tired and
threw him out.

Hidden in Rome is a relatively unassuming Church. Inside are some of his amazing works.
